## Key Catalysts
- **Earnings Momentum**: Sustained EPS growth with a 100% earnings beat rate over the past 4 quarters, including a **+10.6% surprise** in Jun 2025, bolstering investor confidence.
- **Innovation Pipeline**: Potential new product launches or ecosystem expansions in the technology sector could drive incremental revenue.
